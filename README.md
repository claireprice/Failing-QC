## Overview

**QC Failure** is an interactive educational tool designed to simulate a **quality control failure investigation** in a clinical chemistry laboratory setting.

Learners are guided through the process of:
- Recognizing QC failure in patient test results
- Evaluating potential technical and clinical causes
- Making decisions to accept or reject results
- Exploring follow-up actions and implications

This case-based tool promotes critical thinking and practical decision-making for those learning about laboratory quality assurance and error handling.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of internal quality control (IQC)
- Identify patterns that suggest QC failure
- Explore common causes of analytical errors
- Practice evaluating whether results can be reported
- Reinforce the link between lab data, clinical context, and lab protocols

---

## Features

- Realistic clinical chemistry case with interactive decision points
- Multiple-choice reasoning steps with feedback
- Visual cues and structured logic for interpretation
- Final outcome summary based on user choices
- Fully browser-based, no installation required

---

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Read the patient scenario and QC context.
3. Follow the prompts to interpret data and make decisions.
4. At the end, review your interpretation and reasoning path.
